A self-hosted personal finance tracker built for DIYers and self-hosters who want complete control over their financial
data.

## Why Pennywise?

Take control of your financial future without surrendering your data to cloud services. Pennywise combines the power of
modern budgeting methodologies with the security and flexibility of self-hosting - because your money deserves better
than rented software.

## Planned Features

- 📊 **Budget Categories** - Organize spending with customizable categories (your way, not theirs)
- 💳 **Smart Credit Card Payments** - Auto-calculate payments to maintain zero balance (outsmart the interest game)
- 📈 **Spending Reports** - Track patterns and trends over time (knowledge is financial power)
- 👥 **Family Support** - Shared budgets for households (financial harmony, self-hosted style)
- 🔒 **Complete Data Ownership** - Self-hosted means your data is truly yours (as it should be)
- 📱 **Mobile Responsive** - Manage finances from any device (freedom doesn't require an app store)

### Roadmap

Building financial freedom, one feature at a time:

- [ ] Core budgeting functionality (the foundation of financial control)
- [ ] Transaction management (track every penny)
- [ ] Credit card payment optimization (beat the system at its own game)
- [ ] Reporting and analytics (insights that matter)
- [ ] Deployment documentation (share the wealth)

## Deployment

Pennywise is designed to be self-hosted - your server, your rules, your data. Deployment guides for common platforms
will be provided closer to the initial release (good things take time).

## Contributing

We believe financial software should be built by the community, for the community. Whether you're fixing bugs, adding
features, improving documentation, or sharing ideas - every contribution moves us closer to true financial independence.
